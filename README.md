 ## Qualtrics Survey Data

Qualtrics was used to adminster a set of measures of individual attributes in addition to percecptions of team process. 

### Psychological Collectivism

A 15-item measure of psychological collectivism developed and validated by Jackson and colleagues (2006) was used in the study. The measure captures five facets of of collectvism: preference, reliance, concern, norm acceptance, and goal priority  (3 items per facet). Responses can be assessed a the scale level (single variable) or facet level (five variables). Responses are provided on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. 

According to Jackson et al. (2006):
* Perference and concern facets are relevant to cooperation as they "create a sense of attraction in the group"
* Goal priority and reliance facets are relevant to cooperation as they "facilitate the development of interdependence"
* Norm acceptance facet is relevant to cooperation, specifically prosocial behavior
